Quiz 01 :-

Question: Get the user input for three numbers (a,b,c).Calculate the LCM(Least Common Multiple) for first two numbers(a,b) and calculate the GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) for last two numbers(b,c).


// Read three numbers
echo "Enter the first number: "
read a
echo "Enter the second number: "
read b
echo "Enter the third number: "
read c

// Save original values for LCM calculation
x=$a
y=$b

// Find GCD of a and b
while [ $b -ne 0 ]
do
    temp=$b
    b=$((a % b))
    a=$temp
done
gcd_ab=$a

// Find LCM of x and y
lcm_ab=$(( (x * y) / gcd_ab ))

// Now, find GCD of original b (y) and c
b=$y
d=$c

while [ $d -ne 0 ]
do
    temp=$d
    d=$((b % d))
    b=$temp
done
gcd_bc=$b

// Print results

echo "LCM of $x and $y is: $lcm_ab"
echo "GCD of $y and $c is: $gcd_bc"
