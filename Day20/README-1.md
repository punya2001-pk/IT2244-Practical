# System V Message Queue Example in C

This project demonstrates **Interprocess Communication (IPC)** using **System V message queues** in C. It consists of two separate programs:

- `send.c` — sends a message to the queue
- `receive.c` — receives a message from the queue

---

## 📦 Files

- `send.c` — Code to send a message to a message queue
- `receive.c` — Code to receive a message from the same message queue
- `progfile` — A dummy file used with `ftok()` to generate a unique key

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The sender (`send.c`) creates or accesses a message queue and sends a message typed by the user.
2. The receiver (`receive.c`) reads the message from the queue and deletes the queue after receiving.

Both programs use a shared key generated by `ftok("progfile", 65)` to ensure they are communicating through the same message queue.

---

## 🛠️ Compilation

Make sure you have GCC installed. Then run:

```bash
gcc send.c -o send
gcc receive.c -o receive
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Create the `progfile` (if not already existing)
```bash
touch progfile
```

### 2. Run the sender
```bash
./send
```
_Type your message and press Enter._

### 3. Run the receiver in another terminal or after sender
```bash
./receive
```
_It will display the received message._

---

## 📋 Example

```bash
$ ./send
Write data: Hello from sender!
Data send is: Hello from sender!

$ ./receive
Data received is: Hello from sender!
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- Both programs must be run on the same machine.
- This example uses **System V message queues**, not POSIX.
- The message queue is removed automatically after receiving.
